# Showroom Construction Project Plan (Excel Gantt Chart)
Designed a detailed project management schedule using Excel to plan and track the construction of a showroom facility. The project includes task sequencing, timeline allocation, resource ownership, and risk monitoring across planning and execution phases. A dynamic Gantt chart was developed to visualize dependencies, identify critical activities, and support efficient coordination of permits, vendor work, installations, and performance tracking.
